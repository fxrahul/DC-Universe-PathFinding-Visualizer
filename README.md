# DC Universe Pathfinding Visualizer
DC Universe Pathfinding Visualizer is the project based on finding shortest path using graph algorithms. In DC Universe, Flash helps out Batman to meet Wonder woman by finding him the shortest path. You can access my project here : https://dc-universe.herokuapp.com/

### Motivation
I like visualizations as much as I love algorithms. So, I have tried to combine both and present you this interesting project. As a DC fan, I have used DC characters for visualization. I hope you enjoy and appreciate my work.

### Algorithms
[Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) : It is weigted algorithm and guarantees shortest path.

[Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) : It is unweigted algorithm and guarantees shortest path.

[Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) : It is unweigted algorithm and does not guarantees shortest path.
